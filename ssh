#> ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@remote-host

--Alternatively if the server is not installed with openssh-clients (a package which provides ssh-copy-id command utility) 
--you can copy the authentication key with the command:

#>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@remote-host "cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

#>ssh user@remote-host



--Also check this if you are having issues
#>chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# service sshd restart
